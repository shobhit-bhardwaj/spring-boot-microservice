Service Discovery and Registry by Eureka -
1. Eureka Server - This is Eureka server which acts as a master for all Eureka client.
2. Eureka Client - Order Service and Payment Service are two Eureka Client. Order Service hits Payment Service by
RestTemplate for making a payment. The service invokation can be direct by URL and PORT but we have a hard coded
dependency on Url and Port, and we also can't use Load Balancer. For its resolution, we need Eureka Server in which
we host clients and direct use them by their name.
