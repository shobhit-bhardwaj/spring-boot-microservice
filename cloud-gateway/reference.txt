Cloud API Gateway is use to access any MicroService on basis of its URL pattern. This is a single point of contact of
all the micro services. We can also use Zuul API Gateway but Zuul don't provide gateway for the non blocking micro
services and it is build on old servlet 2.5. Cloud API Gateway is latest and register as a Eureka Client. It contains
mappings of all the micro services and we can access these services on single host and port which is its own host and
port. Different services are separated by their context path or any URL pattern.
